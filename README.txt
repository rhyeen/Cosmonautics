To run, you only need to start the client by running the .exe:
Cosmonautics\GraphicsWindow\bin\Debug\GraphicsWindow.exe

To run on a server, first start the server by running in a terminal:
Cosmonautics\GraphicsWindow\bin\Debug\ServerC.exe

Multiple clients should theoretically be able to connect and play together
though this project is still in development, and a stable build is not
currently available for multiplayer support.
